Take the single smallest most important task from TODO.md, and start working on it.
When the task is done, make sure ./gradlew build passes.
Once it passes, review the TODO.md and update it with the current state. Check specs/DISTRIBUTED_SESSION.md for more info.
Before finishing commit all your changes with a nice and brief summary message.
When there is nothing left to do, answer with a single line saying "DONE"
