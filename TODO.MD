- [x] Migrate `ConfigMap` and `Secret` resources to Kustomize generators (`configMapGenerator`, `secretGenerator`)
- [x] Group resources in `k8s/base` by service/component for better organization
- [x] Add resource limits/requests to all deployments in `base`
- [x] Explore using Kustomize patches for environment-specific configurations (e.g., `dev` vs `prod`)
- [x] Decommission `local-deploy.sh` in favor of `local-deploy-kustomize.sh` once migration is fully verified
- [x] Define production-specific secrets and configmaps in `k8s/overlays/prod`
- [ ] Implement network policies for better isolation between services
- [ ] Configure TLS for Ingress in `prod` overlay
- [x] Externalize Keycloak host configuration to avoid hardcoded values in `base`
- [ ] Refactor multi-resource YAML files (e.g., service.yaml) into separate files (service.yaml, deployment.yaml, etc.) for better granularity
- [ ] Implement HorizontalPodAutoscaler for high-traffic services
- [x] Update `k8s/README.md` to reflect the current Kustomize structure and overlays
