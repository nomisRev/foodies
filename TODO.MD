- [x] Migrate `ConfigMap` and `Secret` resources to Kustomize generators (`configMapGenerator`, `secretGenerator`)
- [x] Group resources in `k8s/base` by service/component for better organization

- [ ] Explore using Kustomize patches for environment-specific configurations (e.g., `dev` vs `prod`)
- [ ] Decommission `local-deploy.sh` in favor of `local-deploy-kustomize.sh` once migration is fully verified
