- Always use Gradle's Version Catalog, never hardcode dependencies in build.gradle.kts
- The application uses `foodies.local` as the hostname, configured in `/etc/hosts` pointing to localhost
- Do not use exceptions for control flow but use proper types and domain modeling
- Use `./gradlew localDeployK8s` to deploy the k8s cluster
